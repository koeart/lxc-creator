This is a little python project which shall help to setup lxc containers using lxc and lvm.

It makes use of the existing lxc-create scripts and features, but enhances it with some lvm related stuff.

What it does:
- check whether a volume group exists
- creates a logical volume within that group
- creates a filesystem
- runs lxc-debian installation script (TODO: give it a config option)
- creates a lxc-config file (TODO: from a template with your options)

Structure:
lxc.py: the actual script
configs/: folder for your config/template files
configs/globalconfig.cfg: holds some basic configurations. [global] sections is for your name, size etc, [extern] is where the path to the scripts et al are written down. You can crate a basic global config with some preset values if you run lxc.create_sample_config()

What you still need to do:
- make sure you are root
- run it within the vg you want to create the lv in
- better read and check it before you use it

Where is it right now?
right now, the functions can be tested from within a python interpreter

TODO1:
make everything actually run by starting the script

TODO2: Make everything more customizeable by passing commandline options and other templates for example for creating the macadresses and editing the lxc-config.
